You are on a number where your position is denoted by x. You want to travel to another point on the number line y. Normally, the distance to y is simply |y−x|. However, you know there is a teleporter on the number line denoted by two positions a and b. You can teleport from a directly to b or from b directly to a. Teleporting counts as travelling 0 distance. What is the minimum distance you must travel to get from x to y.

Input
One line with four space-separated integers x y a b in that order.

Constraints
1≤x,y,a,b≤100
Output
One integer --- the minimum distance you must travel.

Input
